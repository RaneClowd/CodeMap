CodeMap
=======

My goal is to have a program capable of giving a sort of flow diagram of an Objective-C app. I’m a mobile developer, so while I won’t intentionally make it impossible to use on OSX applications, I also probably won’t be using/testing it out on them either.

The OldCode folder contains an old attempt at this that I’d given up on. I’m a packrat and can’t bring myself to delete it yet. Maybe I’ll re-use some of the code written there.

LibTooling contains the code for the clang libtool to get the target code’s syntax tree. Later on I’ll add more of what’s needed and/or give instructions on how to use it. But for now this is just so I can have the niceties of source control.
